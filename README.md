# FootballScoreHTTP
A program made in Java that allows you to check football scores. Uses the HTTP protocol and the principles of distributed systems.
Consists on a server that waits for clients to connect, and then the clients can watch the match score and update it and all
the other clients will see the updated result made by the other clients. This is all made in a web browser and in that version
the client can add a comment to the on going match and can see all the comments made by other clients.
That program was made to a university subject called Distributed Systems.
